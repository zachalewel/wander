I'm on that level your elevator can't reach.
I got information that the school system doesn't teach.
I got verses that your sunday school wouldn't dare to preach.
2nd comin of christ flow, like woahh.
Raptured you with lyricism, kidnapped your soul.
And change your mind like I penetrated your goals.
